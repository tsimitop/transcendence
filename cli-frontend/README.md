## Pong CLI

You need a Python interpreter to use the cli.
Install Python >=3.10.

Install the dependencies in ```requirements.txt``` using pip.

You can run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It is recommended to use a virtualenv.


Usage: 
```
python3 pong_cli.py <backend url>
```

Then login with your username and password.


After this the userinterface is similar to the web interface.
